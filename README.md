## Description

- I built this project to demonstrate my understanding of **HTML** basics provided by the Odin Project's course guide for learning HTML which can be found in the Credits Section of this Commit.
- This website was able to assist in my memorization of the HTML Boilerplate and its functions associated with each tag.
- By building this recipe website, I was able to better understand the HTML boilerplate, tags, code field organization and web layout design basics.
